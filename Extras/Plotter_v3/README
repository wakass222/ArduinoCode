Sample stl model files to make a plotter using a 3D printer.

Other needed parts list:

The 3D parts in this directory ( Plotter-v3-PenMount-2.stl twice)
or the Plotter-v3-AllParts.stl once, it contains everything except the
table, which is optional and can easily be replaced by some prototyping
board.

Please note that the maximum size of this plotter can be quite large,
but to minimize the elastic effect of the nylon string I advise to keep
the X axis at about 20cm and the Y Axis at 16cm. The steel rods need to
be 2cm larger for the X axis (24cm) and 6cm for the Y Axis (24cm).

Other parts required:
