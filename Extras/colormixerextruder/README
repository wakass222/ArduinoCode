COLORMIXEXTRUDER:

This is the attempt to build a simple color mixing
extruder driver board and controller to drive a 
diamond extruder without modifying an existing 
3D printers driver board to support more stepper
drivers.

The signals of the stepper controller board from
the 3D printers extruder stepper are passed to the 
controller as well as the serial data comming from
the PC.

The controller scans the incommming serial g-code 
data for occurences of the TXX code and sets the
desired color for that tool.

This has been designed for my uControl_v1 driver 
board but should be easily adapted for other driver
boards.

This is alpha software - expect it to be broken.
